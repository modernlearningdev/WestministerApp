            Westminster International School endeavours to be a school of academic excellence through provision of quality education to its learners. The institution comprises of learners of mixed abilities, and our main aim is to mould a learner who can fit in any society. Our teaching and learning methods are in line with the 21ùë†ùë° century teaching methodologies. Since we have learners of different abilities, every learner is catered for, through a satisfactory teacher-pupil ratio. This is done through remedial lessons for non-academically gifted learners and extension work for gifted learners.
